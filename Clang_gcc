Check for update MacOS,
xcode-select --install
If gcc is install but at different folder => Change PATH in Makeconf

Open 

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/Makeconf

In Macos, gcc is install in (check from Terminal %where gfortran
/usr/local/bin/gfortran

Change FLIBS in Makeconf: L/opt/R/arm64/ ==> /usr/local/bin/gfortran
Ex:
FLIBS =  -L/opt/R/arm64/gfortran/lib/gcc/aarch64-apple-darwin20.2.0/11.0.0 -L/opt/R/arm64/gfortran/lib -lgfortran -lemutls_w -lm
To 
FLIBS =  -L/usr/local/gfortran/lib/gcc/aarch64-apple-darwin20.2.0/11.0.0 -L/usr/local/gfortran/lib -lgfortran -lm

Save,
